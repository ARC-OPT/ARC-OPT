# Acceleration-based WBC - Hybrid Robot

The example can be found in [tutorials/rh5v2/rh5v2_hybrid.cpp](https://github.com/ARC-OPT/wbc/blob/master/tutorials/rh5v2/rh5v2_hybrid.cpp), documentation can be found  [here](https://arc-opt.github.io/wbc/rh5v2__hybrid_8cpp.html). To run the tutorial, type
```
cd build/tutorials/rh5v2
./rh5v2_hybrid
```
This tutorial assumes that you have installed hyrodyn and enabled the USE_HYRODYN option when you installed WBC. The example shows acceleration-based WBC on a hybrid dual-arm robot (fixed base). The output are the actuator accelerations and torques that comply with the given task space accelerations.
