# Acceleration-based WBC - Serial Robot

The example can be found in [tutorials/rh5v2/rh5v2.cpp](https://github.com/ARC-OPT/wbc/blob/master/tutorials/rh5v2/rh5v2.cpp), documentation can be found [here](https://arc-opt.github.io/wbc/rh5v2_8cpp.html). To run the tutorial, type
```
cd build/tutorials/rh5v2
./rh5v2
```

This example shows acceleration-based WBC on a serial dual-arm robot (fixed base). The output are the joint acceleration and torques that comply with the given task space accelerations.
