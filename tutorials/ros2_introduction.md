WBC is integrated with [ros2_control](https://control.ros.org/master/index.html). The Whole-Body Controller itself, as well as every task space controller are implemented as [ros2 controllers](https://control.ros.org/master/doc/ros2_controllers/doc/controllers_index.html), inheriting from [ChainableControllerInterface](https://github.com/ros-controls/ros2_control/blob/master/controller_interface/include/controller_interface/chainable_controller_interface.hpp). 

See [here](https://github.com/ARC-OPT/wbc_ros/blob/main/doc/parameters/whole_body_controller_parameters.md) for a description of the WBC parameters.
